obsidian-moon/project-utilities
===============================

This is a collection of useful code that I have been using across several projects and want to make available for clients
that I support. The code features here are compatible with [Symfony Components](https://symfony.com/components) and/or
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/).

Installation
------------

`composer require obisidian-moon/project-utilities`
